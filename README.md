## Day One
### First Challenge
#### <a href="https://github.com/noufalsalem/HackerRank/blob/d774976133213fb64082318c5c0d0579672c5669/1%20Week%20Preparation%20Kit/Plus%20Minus.java"> Plus Minus </a>
- For an input of an array of 5, determine how many numbers are positive, how many are negative, how many are zero, and the ratio of each. 

### Second Challenge
#### <a href="https://github.com/noufalsalem/HackerRank/blob/d774976133213fb64082318c5c0d0579672c5669/1%20Week%20Preparation%20Kit/Mini-Max%20Sum.java"> Mini-Max Sum </a>
- For an input of an array of 5, determine the minimum sum of 4/5 numbers, the maximum sum of 4/5 numbers, and display them on the same line with space in between.
- Challenge hints that the output could be greater than a 32-bit integer, therefore have totalSum be of "long" datatype

### Third Challenge
#### <a href="https://github.com/noufalsalem/HackerRank/blob/9bd99c47d230721789be72da2ef8c9c6d888170f/1%20Week%20Preparation%20Kit/Time%20Conversion.java"> Time Conversion </a>
- Input time of 12hr format should be converted to 24hr format and then printed

## Day Two
### First Challenge
#### <a href="1 Week Preparation Kit/Lonely Integer.java"> Lonely Integer </a> 
- From an input of array of <i>n</i> integers - where every integer occurs twice except for one - return the unique element that occurs only once. 

### Second Challenge
#### <a href ="1 Week Preparation Kit/Diagonal Difference.java"> Diagonal Difference </a> 
- From an input of <i>n</i> for size of matrix, then input of <i>n</i> separated matrix elements a[i][j], return the absolute value of the diagonal difference from left to right, then right to left.
