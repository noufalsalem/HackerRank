### First Challenge
- "Plus Minus" - plusMinus() function takes INTAGER_ARRAY arr as paramater
- For an input of an array of 5, determine how many numbers are positive, how many are negative, how many are zero, and the ratio of each. 

### Second Challenge
- "Mini-Max Sum" - logic used in my code: totalSum - max = minSum, totalSum - min = maxSum 
- For an input of an array of 5, determine the minimum sum of 4/5 numbers, the maximum sum of 4/5 numbers, and display them on the same line with space in between.
- Challenge hints that the output could be greater than a 32-bit integer, therefore have totalSum be of "long" datatype.
